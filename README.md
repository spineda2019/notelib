# notelib
This is a pet project to make a nice note taking app. I have found notetaking
to be a very important but underappreciated and underutilized tool in the tech
world. I am a minimalist at heart, so while I do love tools like notion, it
just has too many moving parts to my liking.

This project will be built using Qt 6 and largely C++20 (if I get up to speed
on 23 in time, I may use features for that here too).
